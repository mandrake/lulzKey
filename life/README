The most important service. Process and memory management.

The first service that's ran from kernel mode, it stays in kernel mode at first :)

------

A new process starts with a thread, which has a standard priority level.

The scheduler choose a process by looking at the priority etc and then chooses a thread with the same policy.

A process can set the priority of its threads, so the most important are often executed.
