LOL MICROKERNEL.

Yes yes I know, another gay OS, just trying something to learn stuff about kernel land ^_^

Used software:
    - app-emulation/qemu-0.11.0
    - sys-devel/gcc-4.4.2
    - sys-devel/binutils-2.20

If you have problems ensure that you're using those versions or don't bother meh.

To compile remember to download lolibc [http://github.com/meh/lolibc], extract it into lolibc/
and run make 32bit=1.
